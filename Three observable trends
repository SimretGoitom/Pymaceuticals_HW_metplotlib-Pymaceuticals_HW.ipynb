                                                      Three observable trends
•	Drug Capomulin, according to the study, is the most effective and successful drug treatment in, decreasing tumor volume, containing metastatic spread and survival rate throughout the course of treatment.
•	Other treatments were less effective than no treatments. Infubinol was slightly effective. Mice treated with Infubinol had shrunk tumor growth and metastatic site expanse than mice treated with Ketapril or placebo, although the death rate was higher than the other two drugs studied. Infubinol was perhaps more effective than the placebo and requires additional investigation and alteration.
•	Ketapril is less effective at limiting tumor volume and metastatic spread than the placebo in this study. Mice treated with Ketapril and placebo had similar growth of metastatic sites errors that overlapped. This may mislead to assume that Ketapril is not an effective method of treatment.
